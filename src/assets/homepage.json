We recommend that you take a closer look at <u><a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/newspapers/\">our overview of newspapers</a></u>."

            "question": "Why can’t I see everything? How do I get access to the full corpus?",
            "answer": "For legal reasons we can only show a subset of the newspapers. To gain access to the whole collection, you need to sign a Non-Disclosure-Agreement (NDA) which is available for download here. We will provide you with a user account once we received the signed NDA back from you."

            "question": "Can I download everything? Do you have an API?",
            "answer": "Impresso users can download text and metadata for a maximum of 10.000 articles in form of a .csv file to allow - for example - further processing topic modeling on personally curated corpora. For advanced users we provide access via an API. If this is of interest to you, please contact us at <u><a href=\"mailto:info@impresso-project.ch\">info@impresso-project.ch</a></u>."

Inevitably, they fail sometimes and make mistakes which we need to remain aware of. But we believe that despite these imperfections, the opportunities offered by the automated enrichment of historical texts by far outweighs these downsides."
