          "description": [
          "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) describes the automated identification of letters in scanned images. As a byproduct, most OCR tools also detect other elements in a scanned image, for example images or tables. The OCR software typically preserves the coordinates for each letter on the scanned image. These coordinates are the basis for the yellow highlighting for keywords in the facsimile view of an article. Optical Layout Recognition (OLR) identifies article boundaries on a page which we highlight in blue in impresso.",
          "All this information is stored in standardized forms. A frequently used format is METS/ALTO XML developed by the Library of Congress, where METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Schema) stores information such as article titles and the publication date of the issue and ALTO (Analyzed Layout and Text Object) contains the information on the position of letters, images and article boundaries. To summarise, digitisation produces three layers of new information that shape its later use: <ul><li>CR creates keyword-searchable text</li><li>OLR identifies the organisation of articles on a page. Search within articles becomes possible as well as the classification of article types, e.g. advertisements or obituaries</li><li>METS/ALTO stores the location of characters on the scanned image and additional metadata.due</li></ul>",
          "The quality of text and layout recognition can vary significantly between newspapers. Most critical are the materials on which they are applied: Paper scans in high resolution are for example better suited than scans from microfilm in lower resolutions. At the same time, tools for OCR and OLR continue to improve and some libraries regularly re-OCR and re-OLR their collections.",
          "Digitized text organized in article boundaries is the foundation of the text processing we undertake as part of the impresso project. Variations in the quality of the underlying text also negatively affects the quality of topic modeling, named entity recognition, text reuse and word embeddings.",
          "Finally, the impresso team from Zurich also <a href='https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0694.html'>demonstrated</a> that for lower quality scans, techniques used for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) can outperform standard OCR tools.",

          "description": [
          "They are referential units which underlie the meaning of texts. Their definition is quite vague, but as a rule of thumb, they correspond more or less to proper names.The important criteria is here the name, which acts as a ‘rigid designator’: to differentiate for instance a common definite description  such as ‘the pope’ referring to any pope, from the mention of a particular named entity such as ‘Pope Francis’.",
          "In a first step, Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) automatically detects  and categorize mentions of e.g. a person in a text. For now we make use of a rule-based system, and will also apply machine learning techniques at a later stage. A rule-based system tries to recognize patterns based on morphological and lexical clues. For example, the pattern  [uppercase token + uppercase letter + punctuation + known surname] could recognize ‘George W. Bush’. A machine learning-based system requires, for its part, a large number of annotated entities in texts (examples of persons, institutions and locations), from which it will “learn” what they look like and how to identify them. In a second step we try to link entity mentions to a knowledge base containing entities (with their unique identifiers). We use AIDA Light for the linking and Wikidata as the reference knowledge base. This allows us to link one mention of a person named ‘Winston Churchill’ to the former British prime minister across the corpus (when it works). Finally, in the near future we will be looking for relations between entities, for example  a born_in relation between a person and a location entity, colleague_of between two persons, alma_mater between a person and an organisation (in this case could be of subtype ‘Educational’).",

          "For the global topic modeling, we used MALLET and used the following steps to prepare the data: ",
          "<ul><li>Language identification</li><li>Linguistic processing (Lemmatization; note that historical spellings cannot currently be lemmatized correctly; terms like “Bundesrath” can therefore not be found in topic models)</li><li>Reduction to nouns and proper nouns in order to improve the interpretability of topics.</li></ul>",
          "Topic models have been trained on articles which contain a minimum of 10 nouns. For articles with less than 10 nouns we infer topics. In this context, training means the following: Given a set of documents and a fixed number of topics, we compute topic-word and topic-document distributions that make our documents probable. Inference: Given a topic model and an unseen document, we determine a topic distribution for the document that explains its observed words best.",
          "Large datasets like ours can not be easily processed with MALLET, instead we subsample the articles in order to be able to process them. For the sample we randomly select about 30% of the articles for French (as we did not have that much of German articles, we did not sample for this language so far).",
          "MALLET requires us to pre-determine the number of topics it should generate. We set this number to 100. This number is arbitrary but represents our attempt to capture the complexity of the newspaper content without overburdening users by offering too many topics to inspect.",
          "In the interface, a topic is linked to an article if its proportion is at least 2% for French and 0.5% for German (this may change to 2% in the near future). This is to ensure that topics remain distinctive and can indeed serve as search facets.",

          "These representations, often called ‘word embeddings’, are empirically learned on our corpus data by neural networks. These techniques are based on the assumption of distributionalism, which says ‘you shall know a word by the company it keeps’ (Firth, J. R. 1957:11). Words that occur in similar contexts will have similar meanings. In our case, similar words are either semantically related (armistice - hostilités - capitulation - co-belligérance), or they are inflection variants (gedenken - angedenken - gedenk), or simply OCR errors (Eidgenoffenschast vs. Eidgenossenschaft vs. Eidgenofsenschaft).",
