In other cases, newspaper pages were digitized successfully but not subjected to text recognition (OCR).

When discovering non readable .zip files in the sources we received on hard drives, it was not possible to recover them nor to know where the corruption came from.

We can group or differentiate the articles based on these information (compare) and have a first impression of what a list of articles contains (inspect).",

In the central column, we display the overlap of the two chosen queries or collections, which is practically another query, adding all the filters from the two other columns. You can open this overlapping query in the search environment to read the articles beneath.",
              "In the compare view, you can focus on how both columns overlap. This view follows similar principles as the inspect view, but focuses on the overlapping items per each category. You can choose to display the scale of comparison as linear or square root, which allows for an easier comparison of heterogeneous sizes. You can also change the measure of the comparison from absolute to percentage. It means that you can see either how many individual articles are present in both queries and how many overlap or show what is the proportion of both queries that overlap. Changing this will change the order of elements being displayed: in absolute numbers, you will see first for instance the newspapers with the most articles while in the percentage view, you will see first the newspapers with the highest proportion of overlapping articles in both columns. Switching scales and sorting may help you keep track of the context of your queries or collections."

The identification is based on visual features that change rapidly over time and between the newspaper titles: the visual presentation of obituaries is not constant over decades and relies therefore on intensive manual annotation.

You may notice a difference of temporal distribution of the missing files. This is simply because the pages are contained in a folder that constitutes a newspaper issue. A missing issue corresponds to a corrupted archive, while missing pages correspond to empty files within an issue folder. These numbers are not indicative of the missing physical issues in the providers’ collection (e.g. a newspaper issue that was printed, but was not preserved in the physical archive). They do not indicate the number of issues that could not be printed for material reasons (strike, shortage of paper, censorship etc.) nor they are an indication of the proportion of newspapers that have been digitised, compared to all historical newspapers."

As a byproduct, most OCR tools also detect other elements in a scanned image, for example images or tables. The OCR software typically preserves the coordinates for each letter on the scanned image. These coordinates are the basis for the yellow highlighting for keywords in the facsimile view of an article. Optical Layout Recognition (OLR) identifies article boundaries on a page which we highlight in blue in impresso.",

A frequently used format is METS/ALTO XML developed by the Library of Congress, where METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Schema) stores information such as article titles and the publication date of the issue and ALTO (Analyzed Layout and Text Object) contains the information on the position of letters, images and article boundaries. To summarise, digitisation produces three layers of new information that shape its later use: <ul><li>OCR creates keyword-searchable text</li><li>OLR identifies the organisation of articles on a page. Search within articles becomes possible as well as the classification of article types, e.g. advertisements or obituaries</li><li>METS/ALTO stores the location of characters on the scanned image and additional metadata.</li></ul>",

For now we make use of a rule-based system, and will also apply machine learning techniques at a later stage. A rule-based system tries to recognize patterns based on morphological and lexical clues. For example, the pattern  [uppercase token + uppercase letter + punctuation + known surname] could recognize ‘George W. Bush’. A machine learning-based system requires, for its part, a large number of annotated entities in texts (examples of persons, institutions and locations), from which it will “learn” what they look like and how to identify them. In a second step we try to link entity mentions to a knowledge base containing entities (with their unique identifiers). We use AIDA Light for the linking and Wikidata as the reference knowledge base. This allows us to link one mention of a person named ‘Winston Churchill’ to the former British prime minister across the corpus (when it works). Finally, in the near future we will be looking for relations between entities, for example  a born_in relation between a person and a location entity, colleague_of between two persons, alma_mater between a person and an organisation (in this case could be of subtype ‘Educational’).",
