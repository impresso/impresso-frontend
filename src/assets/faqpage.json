            "question": "Which newspapers do you have in your corpus?",
            "answer": "In a nutshell, the impresso corpus contains the historical newspaper collections of the Swiss National Library, the National Library of Luxembourg, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Le Temps, the Valais State Archives and the Swiss Economic Archives. We recommend that you take a closer look at <u><a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/#/newspapers/\">our overview of newspapers</a></u>."

          {
            "question": "Why can’t I see everything? How do I get access to the full corpus?",
            "answer": "For legal reasons we can only show a subset of the newspapers. To gain access to the whole collection, you need to sign a Non-Disclosure-Agreement (NDA) which is available for download here. We will provide you with a user account once we received the signed NDA back from you."

          {
            "question": "Can I download everything? Do you have an API?",
            "answer": "impresso users can download text and metadata for a maximum of 10.000 articles in form of a .csv file to allow - for example - further processing topic modeling on personally curated corpora. For advanced users we provide access via an API. If this is of interest to you, please contact us at <u><a href=\"mailto:info@impresso-project.ch\">info@impresso-project.ch</a></u>."

            "question": "What is a Named Entity?",
            "answer": "<p>Named entities are defined entities, that means identifiable persons, institutions, locations. The important criteria is here the name: to differentiate for instance a common noun such as [pope] from the mention of a particular named entity such as [Pope Francis].</p><p>The improved automated recognition of named entities in historical texts is one of impresso’s research objectives.</p>"

          {
            "question": "I have noticed mistakes in the texts and among the entities. Where do they come from?",
            "answer": "We use state-of-the-art tools to improve the quality of the OCR and to identify persons, locations and institutions. Inevitably, they fail sometimes and make mistakes which we need to remain aware of. But we believe that despite these imperfections, the opportunities offered by the automated enrichment of historical texts by far outweighs these downsides."
