            "description": [
              "<ol><li><b>OCR (Optical Character Recognition):</b> OCR is the automated process of identifying and converting printed text from scanned images into machine-readable text. In addition to recognizing letters and characters, OCR tools can detect elements like images, tables, and preserve the coordinates of each character within the scanned image. These coordinates allow features such as keyword highlighting in facsimile views of articles (highlighted in yellow in the Impresso app), making it easier to locate text within the original layout.</li><li><b>OLR (Optical Layout Recognition):</b> OLR identifies the structure of a scanned newspaper page by recognizing article boundaries. This is displayed in blue within the Impresso app and helps distinguish between different types of content, such as news articles, advertisements, or obituaries. OLR enhances the search and classification experience by allowing for more structured and accurate text searches.</li><li><b>METS/ALTO:</b> METS and ALTO are XML standards used to store the output of OCR and OLR processes. These standards, developed by the Library of Congress, ensure that the data from scanned images is well-organized and accessible.<ul><li><b>METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Schema):</b> Stores metadata such as article titles, publication dates, and structural information about the newspaper issue.</li><li><b>ALTO (Analyzed Layout and Text Object):</b> Stores the layout data, including the position of text, images, and article boundaries on the page.</li></ul><li><b>ASR (Automated Speech Recognition):</b> ASR is the technology used to convert spoken language into machine-readable text. It processes audio content by recognizing speech patterns and transcribing them into written form. ASR is commonly employed in applications such as voice assistants, transcription services, and multimedia processing. In the context of historical research, ASR can be used to transcribe digitized broadcasts, interviews, and oral histories, making audio-based sources accessible for textual analysis, similar to the way OCR enables the processing of printed materials.</li></ol><p><b>Impact on Impresso:</b> The quality of Impresso's text processing (including features like topic modeling and named entity recognition) depends heavily on the quality of OCR, OLR and ASR outputs. For printed materials, the effectiveness of OCR and OLR can vary significantly based on the resolution of the source material. For example, high-resolution paper scans generally yield better results than lower-resolution microfilm scans. Similarly, the clarity of ASR outputs for audio sources depends on the quality of the original recordings, with factors like background noise and speaker clarity affecting accuracy. However, tools for OCR, OLR, and ASR are continuously evolving. Many libraries regularly update their collections with improved OCR/OLR technologies, and the quality of ASR models continues to improve, particularly with advancements in machine learning. For lower-quality scans, the Impresso team from Zurich <a href='https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/177164/'>demonstrated</a> that techniques used for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) can outperform standard OCR tools.</p><p><b>Further reading</b><ul><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optical_character_recognition&oldid=920815843'>Wikipedia “Optical Character Recognition.”</a></li><li><a href='http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets'>Library of Congress. “METS Specifications.”</a></li><li><a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/automatic-speech-recognition'>ScienceDirect “Automatic Speech Recognition - an overview.</a></li><li><a href='https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/archival-digital-turn/'>Ranke.2 lesson “The digitisation of newspapers: how to turn a page”: Bunout, Estelle, and Marten Düring. “The Digitisation of Newspapers: How to Turn a Page.” In <i>From the Archival to the Digital Turn · Ranke.2.</i></a></li><li><a href='https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/177164/'>Ströbel, Phillip Benjamin, and Simon Clematide. “Improving OCR of Black Letter in Historical Newspapers: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of HTR Models on Low-Resolution Images.”</a></li></ul>"

The important criteria is here the name, which acts as a ‘rigid designator’: to differentiate for instance a common definite description  such as ‘the pope’ referring to any pope, from the mention of a particular named entity such as ‘Pope Francis’.</p><p>In a first step, Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) automatically detects  and categorize mentions of e.g. a person in a text. For now we make use of a rule-based system, and will also apply machine learning techniques at a later stage. A rule-based system tries to recognize patterns based on morphological and lexical clues. For example, the pattern  [uppercase token + uppercase letter + punctuation + known surname] could recognize ‘George W. Bush’. A machine learning-based system requires, for its part, a large number of annotated entities in texts (examples of persons, institutions and locations), from which it will “learn” what they look like and how to identify them. In a second step we try to link entity mentions to a knowledge base containing entities (with their unique identifiers). We use AIDA Light for the linking and Wikidata as the reference knowledge base. This allows us to link one mention of a person named ‘Winston Churchill’ to the former British prime minister across the corpus (when it works). Finally, in the near future we will be looking for relations between entities, for example  a born_in relation between a person and a location entity, colleague_of between two persons, alma_mater between a person and an organisation (in this case could be of subtype ‘Educational’).</p><p>These are baselines, and the improvement of automated recognition and linking of named entities in historical texts is one of impresso’s <a href='https://impresso-project.ch/project/objectives/'>research objectives</a>.</p><p><b>Further reading </b></p><ul><li><a href='https://impresso-project.ch/news/nlp/documentation/2018/06/12/tradingzone-ner.html'>Impresso blog post: Named entity processing in a nutshell.</a></li><li><a href='https://github.com/Impresso/named-entity-tutorial-dh2019'>Impresso.

For instance, between January 1, 1738, and December 31, 1740, “Europe” was mentioned 2 times in 2 articles, with a total of 2,811 tokens during this period. Because the corpus size was relatively small, the proportion of mentions led to a high frequency calculation of 711.74 ppm.
